# Challenge

We landed on these questions:

1. What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? 
2. How does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? 
3. What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?

The following analyses will answer our questions. To understand this analysis please follow the tableau story that can be found here: [Proposal for Challenge in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kalkidan.alemayehu#!/vizhome/BikesharingDataProposal/Story1).

### NYC Citi Bike Analysis

Firstly, in order to implement the Citi Bike business in Des Moines it is important to understand the business structure in New York City. I use Citi bike data for the month of August 2019 to display the information in regards to bike usage. According to the viti bike data the number of records is 2,344,224. This number symbolizes the total usage of bicycles within the month of August only. 

Secondly, we present the gender breakdown of bicycle usage. This is an important factor to understand which demography to focus on. In this case males use the Citi Bike program more than females and the unknown category. With this data, we can conclude that having higher male percentage in a city would benefit the citi bike program. 

Lastly, we have the average trip duration displayed to show how far the bike users travel. For the most part the trip duration is consistent across different ages and it shows that the trip does not last very long.


### Bike Stations

I included this analysis to show that the location of the bicycle stations are important. Based on the chart displayed, we can conclude that the downtown core of the city is the busiest area for citi bike usage. The starting and ending points are denser in the area of New York City where historical landmarks used as tourist attractions are located. 


### Gender Diversity in Two Cities

Moving onto the big picture, we see the comparison of gender diversity in Des Moines and New York City. This comparison is used to show that the citi bike program can be as successful in Des Moines as it is in NYC. 

Both Cities have higher female representation in their populations and the difference is not significant enough to result in a different outcome for bicycle usage frequency. The female percentage in the population of Des Moines is 50.4% which is actually lower than New York's female percentage in the population which is 52.2%. Understanding the gender diversity is important in this case because the majority users of the citi bike program are males. Although the difference between Des Moines and New York City is not significant, it is important to note that Des Moines had higher percentage of Male in the population compared to NYC. This means that the proposal of the citi bike program is more appealing to the population of Des Moines because of the higher presence of major consumers.
