# Bikesharing_

### Project Overview

I used a visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal to investors who are potentially interested in citi bike sharing program. I started by importing, styling and portraying data accurately. Then I created worksheets, dashboards, and a story to visualize key data from New York Citi Bike dataset, Des Moines Census Data and New York City Census Data.

### Objectives

The goals of this challenge include:

1. Displaying data professionally and accurately.
2. Professionally style a Tableau story.
3. Utilizing previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
4. Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.


### Steps taken to form presentation 

1. Form questions that are relevant to the data we are using.
2. Conduct research to answer our proposed questions.
3. Create a story using Tableau. This step is the visual representation of the data and the entire proposal.
4. Write a detailed analysis that captures all the points the investors shouldl know and understand.
